# Entry 001 – Project Kickoff & GitHub Connection

**Date**: 2025-04-18  
**What I Did**:
- Created the `PurposeEngine` project folder
- Set up initial file structure:
  - `purpose_engine.py`
  - `README.md`
  - `dev_journal.md`
  - `debug_log.md`
- Initialized a local Git repository
- Created and pushed a new GitHub repo (`milus-dev/PurposeEngine`)
- Wrote the initial `README.md` to explain the project’s vision and purpose

**What I Learned**:
- How to initialize Git and connect to GitHub
- How to write a clear and professional README that reflects both technical goals and personal intention
- Importance of early project documentation

**Next Steps**:
- Write and run a simple `main()` function
- Practice using the terminal
- Start planning the commitment data structure

# Entry 002 – First Execution of Purpose Engine

**Date**: 2025-04-18  
**What I Did**:
- Wrote a basic `main()` function that prints a welcome message
- Set up the `purpose_engine.py` file correctly
- Learned how to run the file from the terminal using `python purpose_engine.py`
- Practiced using the terminal and understanding the difference between PowerShell and Python's interactive shell

**What I Learned**:
- File names must match exactly (typos break everything)
- If Python shows `>>>`, I’m inside the interpreter — not running the script
- Running code requires being in the right directory and using the right command (`python filename.py`)

**Next Steps**:
- Design the commitment structure
- Implement the `add` functionality
- Write reflection prompts and a deeper CLI interaction

# Entry 002.5 – Sleepiness, Stillness, and Forward Motion

**Date**: 2025-04-18  
**What Happened**:
I kept pushing forward even though I was yawning, eyes watering, and barely holding focus. My mind wanted to keep building — I was excited — but my body was asking me to slow down.

**Why I'm Documenting This**:
Because rest is part of the process too. I’m not just documenting lines of code — I’m documenting the experience of creating something meaningful. Today, that includes listening to when I need to pause.

**Reflection**:
Even though it wasn’t flashy progress, I still:
- Ran my first function from the terminal
- Solved setup errors
- Committed my changes
- Got one step closer to building something real

**Note to Future Me**:
You don’t have to be constantly “on” to be a real developer. Show up, even if it’s sleepy. Then rest.

**Next Steps (after rest)**:
- Begin designing the commitment data structure
- Implement `add_commitment()`
- Continue tracking my growth
